    <h2>Summaries of the Activities:</h2>
    <h3>Activity 1</h3>
    <p>This activity is related to IoT application and its features. Basically, an IoT application refers to exchanging of information between devices using internet. These devices are embedded with sensors, software and other technologies. 
    Features required for an IoT application include Connectivity, Analyzation of data, Sensing, etc. Connectivity means ensuring proper connection between devices. After connecting all the devices, data analyzation is also vital which can be used to make effective decisions. For sensing, different sensors are required. Examples of IoT application: Autonomous or Driverless cars, Smart Irrigation, Smart parking, Smart homes etc.

    <h3>Activity 2</h3>
    <p>
        This activity is related to Smart Building. In terms of IoT, "smart" is something which is having intelligence or autonomous. The features needed for a smart building are sensors for capturing data, data security, automation, system integration so that multiple devices can communicate easily. Some smart-building scenarios can be : Smart home- lighting, security system with fingerprint verification, cameras, refrigerators and all these devices can be controlled with a single unit such as smartphone or laptop. Smart hotel- secure doorlock, smart curtains in the room whose shades can be controlled using a mobile app. Smart offices- controlling air conditioners and ventilation system, managing energy usage using IoT etc.   
    </p>
    <h3>Activity 3</h3>
    <p>
         This activity is in context with control interface in IoT. The high level features of control interface are: capable for real time monitoring, remotely controlled, sustainable. The parts needed include the hardware devices like sensors, output hardware devices and the database system to store data. Moreover, software applications are also  required for using control interface. The users for the control interface are: clients, operators or the connected devices in the network.
